Re:	Framework Contribution

I am in agreeance that the subjects covered in this class should be emphasized more often and earlier in the accounting curriculum.  I didn’t even realize before this class how little I knew about data – how it is created and how it becomes usable - and how little I even thought about it.  There was a lot of information crammed into this one course, and it could have easily been expanded into several.  If accounting students were to learn the content of this course in context with the introduction to accounting courses, I feel it would give us a more complete understanding to build on and a different outlook during our entire education.  It would also give us the leg up we need to continuously evolve and not become obsolete by keeping up with the rapidly changing technological side.
